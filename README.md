## Implementation Approach

### Minimum Viable Implementation (Week 1)

1. **Day 1-2**: Set up SharePoint lists and architecture (00)
2. **Day 3-4**: Implement core flows with error handling (01, 03, 04, 05)
3. **Day 5**: Add monitoring and initial testing (10)

### Standard Implementation (Week 1-2)

1. **Week 1**: Complete Minimum Viable Implementation
2. **Week 2**:
   - Add performance optimizations (02)
   - Implement autofill for UX (06)
   - Add nightly recalc job (07)
   - Set up automated testing (11)

### Enterprise Implementation (Month 1)

1. **Week 1-2**: Complete Standard Implementation
2. **Week 3**:
   - Implement real-time processing (08)
   - Set up comprehensive monitoring
   - Deploy to production environment
3. **Week 4**:
   - Execute migration plan if upgrading (09)
   - Deploy Power BI dashboard (12)
   - Performance tuning and optimization

## Key Features

### Core Capabilities

- **Transaction Processing**: Automated receive and issue workflows
- **Data Validation**: Multi-level validation with business rules
- **Error Recovery**: Self-healing with retry patterns and circuit breakers
- **Audit Trail**: Complete transaction history and change tracking

### Advanced Features

- **Batch Processing**: Optimized for 10,000+ daily transactions
- **Real-time Updates**: Optional real-time inventory updates
- **Performance Monitoring**: Built-in performance metrics and alerting
- **Analytics Dashboard**: Power BI integration for insights

## Prerequisites

### Required

- SharePoint Online with Lists
- Power Automate (Standard or Premium license)
- Microsoft 365 account with appropriate permissions

### Optional but Recommended

- Power Automate Premium (for flows >30 minutes)
- Power BI Pro (for dashboard)
- Azure Application Insights (for advanced monitoring)
